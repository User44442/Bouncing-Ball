# Bouncing Ball with Gravity and Shake Interaction

This project creates an interactive bouncing ball animation using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The ball follows realistic physics, bouncing off walls and the floor while being affected by gravity. Additionally, the ball's bounce height can be increased by shaking the device, thanks to the use of the deviceâ€™s accelerometer.

# Features

- **Realistic Gravity:** The ball falls and bounces based on gravity and collision physics.
- **Shake Interaction:** Shake your device to make the ball bounce higher using the accelerometer.
- **Infinite Bouncing:** The ball continuously bounces off the walls and floor.
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring smooth performance on mobile and desktop devices.

# Live Demo



# Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Structure and canvas setup.
- **CSS:** Styling and layout adjustments.
- **JavaScript:** Handling the animation, gravity, bounce physics, and shake detection using `devicemotion`.
