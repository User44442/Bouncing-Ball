# Bouncing-Ball
This project features a bouncing ball animation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ball follows realistic physics, bouncing off walls and floor, affected by gravity. Shaking the device increases the bounce height using the accelerometer. The animation is responsive and works on both mobile and desktop devices.
